def generate_report_with_gemini(data):

    Generate a detailed environmental sustainability report based on the following data:
    
    ### Environmental Data:
    - Location : "AhemedaBad , Nirma University"
    - Air Quality Index: {data['air_quality']} (lower is better)
    - Temperature: {data['temperature']}°C (ideal range is between -30°C and 50°C)
    - Humidity: {data['humidity']}% (ideal value is 50%)
    - Soil Type: {data['soil_type']} (e.g., loam, clay, peat, etc.)
    - Flood Risk: {data['flood_risk']} (0-1 scale, where 0 indicates no flood risk and 1 indicates very high risk)
    - Seismic Activity: {data['seismic_activity']} (0-1 scale, where 0 indicates low seismic activity and 1 indicates high activity)
    - Wind Patterns: {data['wind_patterns']} m/s (moderate wind speeds between 3 and 10 m/s are ideal)

    ### Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS):
    The ESS is a composite score that evaluates the overall environmental sustainability of a given area based on several critical factors:
    - *Air Quality* (Weight: 25%): The air quality index (AQI) is normalized on a scale where lower AQI values result in a higher score, as better air quality contributes significantly to sustainability.
    - *Temperature* (Weight: 15%): Temperatures closer to moderate values (within the range of -30°C to 50°C) yield better scores, as extreme temperatures may pose environmental stress.
    - *Humidity* (Weight: 10%): Humidity levels close to 50% are considered ideal for environmental sustainability, providing balance between dryness and moisture.
    - *Flood Risk* (Weight: 15%): Lower flood risk improves sustainability scores since areas with lower flood risk are more resilient to climate impacts.
    - *Seismic Activity* (Weight: 10%): Lower seismic activity indicates lower risks of natural disasters, thus leading to higher sustainability.
    - *Wind Patterns* (Weight: 15%): Moderate wind speeds (between 3 and 10 m/s) contribute positively, as they are associated with stable weather conditions.
    - *Soil Type* (Weight: 10%): Soil types such as loam, which support strong agricultural productivity, receive higher scores.

    The final ESS for this location is *{data['ess_score']}*, which indicates the overall environmental resilience and sustainability of the area. 

    ### Task for Gemini:
    Based on this ESS and the environmental factors above, generate a comprehensive report detailing the environmental sustainability of this area. Highlight key strengths and weaknesses in the environmental conditions, and provide actionable recommendations for improving the sustainability score. Discuss how each of the above factors contributes to the score and suggest ways to mitigate risks (such as improving air quality, managing flood risk, etc.) to enhance the sustainability of this region.

    The report should also explain what the ESS represents in terms of long-term environmental stability, resilience to climate change, and the potential for sustainable development in the area.
